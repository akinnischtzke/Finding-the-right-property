# Finding the right property
Use data science techniques to find the right real estate property  

This is an on-going project to analyze real estate listings to find a property I might be interested in buying - whether that means it's a good deal or just the perfect fit for me.  

I started with data collection - so far I've scraped about 1,000 listings from the Northern region of New York (which is where I'm interested in) using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.  

Now that I've got a dataset to work with I can start doing some exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and possibly build a recommendation system. Stay tuned!
